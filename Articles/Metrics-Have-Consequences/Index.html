                What would happen if every doctor in the world was rated solely on the
                number of lives they saved. At face value, this seems like a good measure
                of success. A doctor with a higher life-saving ratio would be better than a
                doctor whose patients were constantly dying.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, <em>metrics have consequences</em>. As a result of doctors being
                measured in this way, several unintended negative consequences would
                certainly emerge. For example, if a doctor's salary was tied to this
                metric, they would almost certainly begin <em>gaming the system</em> to
                improve their salary.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, we would see doctors refusing to take on elderly or high-risk
                patients. We'd also see life-saving procedures performed on patients
                without any life-threatening illnesses. In addition, we'd see patients
                being kept alive well beyond the practical and ethical limits of medicine -
                all to improve a number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same is true with the metrics we choose for our teams, our projects,
                and our organizations. There are metrics that will drive positive outcomes
                and there are metrics that will lead to negative outcomes. The challenge is
                deciding which metrics make the most sense for you and your organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following guidelines will help you to decide how to choose effective
                metrics to drive positive outcomes for your organization. Effective metrics
                are:
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Purposeful</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics should drive business outcomes. This starts with your
                organization's "why" (i.e. it's purpose for existing) and forms a hierarchy
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator" target="_blank">KPIs</a>
                down to your day-to-day operations. For each metric, ask yourself, what
                outcome is this driving, and how is it ultimately connected to our overall
                purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Actionable</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics lead to action. You must ask yourself the question, "if this
                metric changes, what will I do in response?" If you don't have a clear
                answer, it's likely a bad metric. Metrics that are not actionable are
                called
                <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/glossary/what-is-a-vanity-metric/" target="_blank">
                    vanity metrics
                </a>
                . They make us feel good but they don't lead to any real action on our
                part.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Reliable</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics are trustworthy. One of the top complaints I hear from
                decision makers is that they don't trust their metrics. Metrics are only as
                good as the data and analysis they are built on. As a result, you need to
                make sure your metrics are based on    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing" target="_blank">clean data</a> and
                statistically-valid methods of    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis" target="_blank">data analysis</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Valuable</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics provide more value than the cost to produce. If the cost to
                create and update a metric is greater than the value it provides your team,
                then it's a bad metric. However, if the insight you derive from a metric is
                more valuable than its cost, your organization is growing as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization" target="_blank">learning organization</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Timely</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics provide you with the insight you need, when you need it. If a
                metric is not available when a decision needs to be made, it has failed at
                its job. If a metric involves a window of time that's too large or too
                small, it has failed as well. Metrics need to be available on time and with
                appropriate time scales.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Impersonal</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics are not used to punish or reward individuals. Human behavior
                inevitably changes in response to being measured. When measured, we will
                "game the system" in our favor. We avoid this
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect" target="_blank">
                    observer effect
                </a>
                by using metrics to guide the improvement of systems, not to measure the
                performance of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Frictionless</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Good metrics require little to no manual effort. If a metric takes
                significant time and energy to create and update, it is less likely to be
                reliably maintained. As a result, we want to make data collection and
                analysis as frictionless as possible; ideally, using automated
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)" target="_blank">
                    data pipelines
                </a>
                from operational systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Necessary</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                The best metric is no metric at all. If you can effectively solve a
                business problem without relying on a metric, you should attempt to do so.
                In <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile</a> organizations, we prefer
                individuals and interactions over processes and tools. So, avoid relying on
                unnecessary metrics and trust your team to get the job done.
