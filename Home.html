            <p>
                I completed my first online course through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="blank">Coursera</a> today.
                The course was <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata" target="blank">Computing for Data Analysis</a> offered by <a href="http://jhu.edu/" target="blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>.
                The course taught students how to write data analysis programs using the statistical programming language <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">R</a>.

            <h2>2013-01-03 - Professional Scrum Master Certification</h2>
            <p>
                Over Christmas break I took the <a href="http://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments" target="blank">Professional Scrum Master Certification (PSM I)</a> exam through <a href="http://www.scrum.org" target="blank">Scrum.org</a>.
                Well, it looks like all of my studying paid off because I received my <a href="http://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Professional-Scrum-Master-Assessments/PSM-I-Assessment/PSM-I-Certification-List">PSM I certification</a> today.
                I took the exam because I want to continue to demonstrate my knowledge of Agile software development and the Scrum process framework.

            <h2>2013-01-01 - Data Explorer Public Preview</h2>
            <p>
                After a year of development, I'm releasing the first public preview of my <a href="http://www.data-explorer.com" target="blank">Data Explorer</a> software.
                I'm not sure if there is a market for this software yet, so I'm just going to get it out there and start collecting feedback.
                If all goes well, I'll continue developing it for another year, release quarterly updates, and plan for a final release sometime in 2013.

                Please note that for some unknown reason, the last 10 minutes of the video got cut off, so unfortunately, the section on growing industry trends is missing.

                I was a guest speaker for two classes at <a href="http://www.iastate.edu" target="blank">Iowa State University</a> today.
                My first presentation was on <a href="/presentations/agile-software-requirements.pdf">Agile Software Requirements</a> for the Software Engineering students.
                My second presentation was on Careers in Software Consulting for the Computer Science students.
                Both presentations went very well and the feedback I received was very positive.
