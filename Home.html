            <h2>2014-06-01 - Some Time Off for the Summer</h2>
            <p>
                After giving it some thought, I've decided that I'm going to take some time off this summer from my side projects.
                I've been spending most of my free time over the past few years on my <a href="http://www.data-explorer.com" target="_blank">open-source software project</a>, <a href="/presentations.html">public speaking</a>, user-group meetings, etc.
                So, I think it's a good time to slow down a bit and enjoy more time with my family, friends, and other interests.
